<h1 id="-how-to-create-a-personal-development-pd-plan">ðŸ“„ <strong>How to create a personal development (PD) plan</strong></h1>

<ul>
  <li>The purpose of a PD plan is to (1) create a <strong>single spot to track</strong> all your PD and (2) have a ready-to-share asset to <strong>communicate your goals</strong> with anyone you work with</li>
  <li>The core components of a PD plan are:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Background</strong> (e.g. personal bio, previous case work, E10s)</li>
      <li><strong>Goals / development areas</strong> (next 6 months, multi-year) and <strong>how others can help</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Strengths</strong> (including inspirational leadership rocks)</li>
      <li><strong>Preferences</strong> (e.g. working styles, personal development, sustainability)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Great PD goals are focused, exciting, tactical and easy to communicate
    <ul>
      <li>Have <strong>1-3 PD goals maximum</strong> (less is better)</li>
      <li>Write as an <strong>objective</strong> (aspirational statement on what you want to learn that excites you) and underpin with <strong>tactics</strong> (specific actions linked to the objective to practice each day)</li>
      <li>Tie to <strong>specific opportunities on the case</strong> (i.e. case team setup, topic) that allow you to demonstrate that skill (be flexible and lean into unique development opportunities!)</li>
      <li>Translate to a <strong>skill tracker dimension</strong> to help you communicate your goal in a common Bain language</li>
      <li>Get <strong>input from your supervisor / SMAP / mentor</strong> so they are bought in and able to support</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The PD plan is a living document that stays current by tying it to the lifecycle of a case:
    <ul>
      <li>At the <em>beginning</em> of the case, confirm all the information in the PD plan is up to date and send to those you work with ahead of your first PD chat</li>
      <li><em>During</em> the case, update the PD plan with additional tactics you learn from your PD chats</li>
      <li>At the <em>end</em> of the case, refresh the development areas and strengths based on the PDR and inspirational leadership feedback (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To support your PD plan, <strong>set up an inspirational leadership session in every case</strong> you do that is &gt;8 weeks long and track over time (strengths &gt; weaknesses)</li>
  <li>A <strong>review tracker</strong> to spot quantitative trends in your personal development reviews (6 month reviews) over time and inform potential PD goals is a helpful supporting asset to the PD plan</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="-how-to-approach-pd-conversations-on-the-case-team">ðŸ“£ <strong>How to approach PD conversations (on the case team)</strong></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Set up recurring PD chats with everyone on your case team
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Supervisor (~1-2 weeks):</strong> Tactics to do your job better than the week before</li>
      <li><strong>Senior Managers (~4 weeks):</strong> Opportunities from case setup, how you can help the team, may have advice if theyâ€™ve seen your work</li>
      <li><strong>Partners (~6-8 weeks):</strong> Almost always a vibe check; Sometimes cover long term plans at Bain; The most useful provide a framework to think about development / learning a new skill</li>
      <li><strong>Wider working team (Choose your own adventure):</strong> Low effort experience share and emotional support (go laugh and/or cry over ice cream together).  <em>**</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The aim is to get your supervisor invested in your development via thoughtful preparation and follow through
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Before the chat, come prepared with reflections (e.g. against PD goals, in general), any upward feedback and the key topics to discuss.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow through:</strong> After you chat, send a short summary email of key takeaways and actions (ideally in a single email chain) and tell them when you</li>
      <li>The rule of thumb is that your supervisor ( / SMAP / mentor) should feel scared if they donâ€™t come as prepared as you are to your PD conversations (because if you donâ€™t prepare, then most will wing it).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
